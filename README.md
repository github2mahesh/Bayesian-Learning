# Bayesian Learning

**Welcome!** This repository hosts lab assignments from the **Bayesian Learning** course, implemented in R programming. All the labs have been done in collaboration with my classmate Dinesh Sundaramoorthy.

**What will you find here?**

* **Three R script files (.RMD):** Each script corresponds to a different lab assignment, covering the following topics:
    * **Lab 1 - Introduction to Bayesian Inference:** Exploring foundational concepts of Bayesian inference and basic statistical modeling techniques.
    * **Lab 2 - Regression and Classification Models:** Developing Bayesian regression and classification models for predictive analytics tasks.
    * **Lab 3 - Advanced Models and Posterior Approximation Methods:** Implementing advanced Bayesian models, posterior approximation techniques, model evaluation, comparison, and variable selection strategies.

**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a personal learning portfolio and does not claim to provide complete solutions or code for specific assignments. It is intended to showcase learning progress and applied skills in Bayesian learning and statistical modeling using R programming.
